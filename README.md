# WayOut
This project was developed as a part of my Master’s dissertation entitled “Assessing Players’ Cognitive Load in Games” — aiming to find a way to measure one’s Cognitive Load while playing video games.
Way Out is a 3D low poly puzzle game where you play as a golem who just woke up in a mysterious laboratory and is trying to figure out the purpose of his existence by solving puzzles and challenges in a dungeon-like environment.
This project was developed using the following technologies: Unity, C#, Blender, HTML, CSS
